<blockquote>
<p>When the image of your future self collides with the reality of now</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Emily J. Smith</em></p>

<p>Recently, a maintenance worker stopped by to fix my leaking kitchen sink and asked, as casually as if they were commenting on the weather, whether I had any kids. My Brooklyn one-bedroom, mind you, is not ideal for kids, let alone another human being or even a dog, but something must have made it feel reasonable to ask. While I’d assessed him as around my age—youngish—his question instantly made me feel not only old but ancient.</p>

<p>At 36, I am neither young (okay, not even “ish”) nor ancient (thank you very much). What I am is an adult. And the idea that someone my age might have children running around is far more reasonable than the fact that I don’t. Still, his question shattered me.</p>

<p>“No,” I told him quickly, laughing to demonstrate the absurdity of his very reasonable inquiry—only to be shattered once again, but worse, by his follow-up.</p>

<p>“Want them?” he asked, casually scanning my sink for who-knows-what as I stood paralyzed on the small square of tiles known as my kitchen, in the corner of the room that makes up the bulk of my apartment.</p>

<p>“Maybe?”</p>

<p>He turned around from the sink and looked me in the eyes for the first time. “You should really know the answer to that by now,” his look said.</p>

<p>I’d always considered the question of whether someone wants children to be a binary one. Some people want kids and some don’t. Did I want them? Well, I didn’t not. So, by process of elimination, I assumed my answer was yes, I did want them. Never mind that I had never felt the smallest urge to have them. But since I was not a woman who did not want kids, I assumed it would arrive eventually.</p>

<p>But the urge never came. As I crossed into my thirties, then mid-thirties, and now late-thirties, most of my friends have had at least one child. So it’s not as if children were a far-off thought like they were in my twenties—on the contrary, they are crowding nearly all of my thoughts and social media feeds. Still, no urge.</p>

<p>What did develop, though, was a more intimate knowledge of what having kids would require. I’d have to find a partner. (I have no desire, let alone the financial means, to raise a child alone.) I’d learned that finding a partner, especially one I wanted to raise children with, would require sacrificing almost all my free time to the dating gods (demons?). Every year it became a little harder. The older I got, the more confident I became, proud of what I had to offer, secure in what I was looking for. Meanwhile, in the world of internet dating, where photos and age loomed as the only real signals of a quality partner, I was getting much worse. I was both swiping less and being swiped on less, a losing battle if there ever were one. And that’s just free time leading up to having a kid. I knew good and well that once I had a child, free time—that coveted space where I crammed nearly everything that brought me solitary joy—would be wiped out from under me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if not having kids is not the lack of something, but the presence of something else?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, everyone I knew repeated the rather cultish mantra that having children was life-changing, that the kind of love a parent had for their kid was unlike anything they’d ever experienced. I’ve never been good at dealing with FOMO. The idea that I would miss out on what everyone seemed to believe was the pinnacle of human experience felt unacceptable.</p>

<p>It seems most people either know they want kids or know they don’t want kids. As someone who was rather indifferent, I assumed the popular default. All my life I’d imagined I’d have children for no particular reason other than I’d absorbed the notion that they were part of what a successful adult’s life looked like. Like many women in the age of Sheryl Sandberg, I was set on “having it all.” To abandon that goal because it was too much work or wasn’t working out felt like giving up on the plan I’d set for myself. It felt like failure.</p>

<p>I’ve heard many writers say they never had a plan. This was not me. As a kid, I watched my parents suffer the mistakes of not having one. Though they are role models to me in so many ways and have always worked impossibly hard, we were frequently behind on bills and regularly had to acquire our furniture from curbside trash. In order to not be broke, I developed a precise and unrelenting life plan. I got into a good school, majored in an excruciating engineering discipline, got the highest paying job I could find, and steadily climbed the corporate ladder. Even when, years into my career, I desperately needed a change from the corporate world that was sucking my soul dry, my big risky adventure was to enroll in a top 10 business school to discover myself.</p>

<p>To let go of a version of yourself, to admit that the things you thought would make you happy—things you’ve worked very hard to get—won’t actually do the trick is not only sad, it’s terrifying. It means confronting the possibility that you might have to start all over again.</p>

<p>Around 30, I began dismantling my plan piece by piece despite myself. Apparently my dream job left me fairly dead inside. My relationships weren’t actually that enjoyable. The suits I’d always admired in J. Crew magazines, the essence of a powerful woman to my young mind, proved far less comfortable than a cozy hoodie and a worn pair of jeans. Over time, I allowed myself to tweak the plan. But the changes always felt reversible—if I ever wanted to throw on a button-down or go back to tech, I could. The question of kids was different. If I didn’t have kids by a certain age, I couldn’t go back. And I was afraid I’d be left with a big gaping hole in my plan.</p>

<p>In her book Motherhood, Sheila Heti contemplates not having kids and asks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can I express the absence of this experience without making central the lack?… Maybe if I could somehow figure out what not having a child is an experience of—make it into an action, rather than the lack of an action—I might know what I was experiencing and not feel so much like I was waiting to act. I might be able to choose my life and hold in my hands what I have chosen and show it to other people and call it mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In writing, people often say that if a line or passage is powerful enough, the writer should “give it space.” This generally means adding a line break, which Heti did. But when I read this line, I had to close the book. I needed a real break from this passage (and many others of Heti’s). It knocked the wind out of me.</p>

<p>What if not having kids is not the lack of something, but the presence of something else? What if having and not having children are equal in the weight of their experience, only different? This simple concept shook me, not just because it presented an alternative that finally felt worthy of consideration, but because it put into words something I had been feeling all along.</p>

<p>While most of my friends were going through the life-changing experience of having children, my life was changing as well. Just in different ways. This dismantling and reconstruction of myself that I had started picking at around 30 had shifted into full gear. I quit my job, I moved across the country, I stopped dating, I started writing—a little at first, then obsessively. I was drafting a new plan for myself, a very different plan from the one I’d worked toward all those years, but one that felt much more me, or at least like the me I had become.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s terrifying to trust yourself to create a meaningful path of your own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question of whether you want kids is easy to answer if all you do is reference an image of your future self, a self where anything is possible. Does that image have kids in it—sure, why not? But if you’re referencing your real, actual self, a person with limitations and joys and new aspirations popping up all the time, the question becomes complicated. It’s only in the past few years, as my window to have biological kids closes, that I’ve stopped referencing my future self to answer this question, and so many others, and instead started to confront myself at present.</p>

<p>Now when I ask myself if I want kids, I understand the question is far from binary. The idea that I maybe might want them one day is not a good enough reason to upend my life now. I understand that it’s too simple to say yes or no. My answer is yes, but at what cost? My answer is sure, but it’s complicated. Or maybe my answer is no, not right now.</p>

<p>The idea of not having a child does, in fact, make me sad. I used to think this sadness was an indication that I must want children. But again, it’s not so simple. Something can be both right and sad. Though it’s a choice (and a privilege to have the choice), there’s still a mourning to knowing you don’t want the thing that seems to make everyone else happy. As my friends become parents—not just far off Facebook friends, but my real around-the-dinner-table friends—I realize this sadness often goes both ways. Parents can believe having kids was the best thing they’ve ever done and, though it can be more taboo to admit it, mourn the not-having as something they’ll never know.</p>

<p>In a beautiful essay on the topic of childlessness, Stephanie Zacharek writes, “What I want to say to younger women who believe that a child-free life is an unfulfilled life is that your future self is a person you haven’t met yet. Don’t presume to know everything about her in advance.” When I was young I imagined that if I passed a certain age without a partner and children, it’d be impossible to make friends, my life would be dull, and I’d grow bitter and sad. The opposite has proven true. I have never made close friends more quickly, I’ve never felt more energized about my work, and I’ve never valued myself quite as much.</p>

<p>The scariest part about not having kids, for me, is that I have to figure out my own way to matter. There is no life inherently relying on me, nothing in my day that reminds me, without doubt, why I’m here. It’s terrifying to trust yourself to create a meaningful path of your own. It’s confusing and challenging and exciting. Just like parenting, but different.</p>
