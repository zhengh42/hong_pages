This is Hong, currently a researcher working at Stanford University, Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, <a href=https://khatrilab.stanford.edu/ target="_blank">Khatri Lab</a>.

I got my PhD from The University of Hong Kong, Department of Clinical Oncology, under the supervision of <a href=http://www.oncology.hku.hk/staff_mlung.html target="_blank">Prof. Maria Lung</a>. I study bioinformatics and cancer genomics. My thesis title was _Identification of Genetic Susceptibility Genes and Characterization of Somatic Mutations in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma_.

My interests focus on big data in genomics and precision medicine. I work with multiple omics datasets, including whole-genome, whole-exome, transcriptome, methylome, etc. I am proficient in several programming languages (R, Python, Linux/Bash, and Perl), statistical analysis, and machine learning methods.

My research has been focused on understanding the genetic and genomic basic of cancer by integrating and digging into the massive amount of sequencing datasets in cancer genomics.

斯坦福大学博士后，香港大学博士，北京大学肄业生，西安交大本科——从千年古都到巍峨帝都，再从全球金融中心到世界科技中心——十年一梦，且惜浮生。

目前从事肿瘤基因组学的研究工作。
