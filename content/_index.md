This is Hong, currently a researcher working at Stanford University, Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, <a href=https://khatrilab.stanford.edu/ target="_blank">Khatri Lab</a>.

My research focuses on understanding the genomic|epigenomic|transcriptomic landscape and immune responses in human diseases, including cancer, aging, and infectious diseases, to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic markers. I work with multiple omics datasets, including whole-genome, whole-exome, transcriptome (RNA-Seq, single cell RNAseq), methylome, etc. I am proficient in several programming languages (R, Python, Linux/Bash, and Perl), statistical analysis, machine learning methods, and data visualization.
