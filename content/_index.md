This is Hong, currently a researcher working at Stanford University, Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, <a href=https://khatrilab.stanford.edu/ target="_blank">Khatri Lab</a>.

My research focuses on understanding the multi-omic landscape (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, etc.) and immune responses in human diseases (cancer, aging, and infectious diseases, etc.), and identifying robust gene signatures and targets for disease diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. I work with multiple omics datasets, including whole-genome, whole-exome, transcriptome (RNA-Seq, single cell RNAseq), methylome, etc. I am proficient in several programming languages (R, Python, Linux/Bash, and Perl), statistical analysis, machine learning methods, data visualization, Docker, and cloud computing.
