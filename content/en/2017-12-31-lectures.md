## N-of-1 networks to personalized cancer treatment
Josh Stuart, 11/18/2017

Cancers come in several forms according to the organ and tissue of origin, the type of mutagen and the impacted genetic pathways that contribute to oncogenic progression. Pan-Cancer analyses across multiple types of cancers, using multiple types of omics data, have identified molecular-based subtypes of clinical importance. Even so, patients may not respond to the usual treatment regime and carry their own unique alterations. I will discuss network integration strategies for building patient-specific networks to model the aberrant wiring in a single personâ€™s tumor. The goal is to then strategies treatment for the person based on critical nodes in the uncovered network.

__Identify closest cancer form__  
__Identify impactful variants__  
__Identify an explanatory network model__

Structure variant discovery by paired-end sequencing

SVs associated with repetitive DNA: model for inversion information in the human genome. They are extremely difficult to detect, and are overlooked using main-stream NGS.

__Strand-Seq__

* Strand specific single cell DNA sequencing
* Inverstion mapping and haplotype phasing of whole genomes
* Detecting SVs >50kb
* Illumina, Matepairs, Pacbio, Stran-Seq comparision


## Big data in biology

Ewan Birney

__Human: the new model organism__

* Similar to most other life forms on earch
* Outbred organisms with pretty good genetics
* Huge cohorts, millions of people
* Big (lots of cells)
* Willing participants -- they take themselves to hospitals to be phenotyped, and genotyped
* Popular organisms -- research into them attracts a lot of funding
* A great model organism for understanding biology -- including human disease
* Human is a very impressive organism for discovery
 + Massive cohort size
 + Well-established phenotyping schemes 
 + Spill-over effect from healthcare studies and practice
 
But,

* You can't fix environment
* You can't sample its development
* You can't do whole-organism perturbation experiements

__Medaka fish__

* Well established model (from 1910s)
* Highly inbred strains
* Excellent genetics
* Genome sequenced
* CRISPR, GFP
* Can inbreed from the wild


## Advances in Cancer Immunotheray
Edgar Engleman, 11/1/2017

__Bariers to effective immunotherapy__

* Tumors contain normal component (self Ag) and immune cells are reluctant to attack self due to:
  + "Central tolerance", deletion of T and B lymphocytes with receptors for self
  + "Peripheral tolerance" = checkpoint molecules, targets
* Tumor microenvironment is highly immunosuppressive (TAM, Treg, MDSC, DC, IDO, adenosine, TGF-beta, IL-10, VEGF)
* Tumors not only escape most therapies that target a single tumor component, they hijack the immune system to promote their growth

__Early approach: tumor-binding mAbs__

* mAbs recognizing tumor associated antigens or molecules that support their growth
* Each mAbs recognizes only a single target
* Trastuzumab (Herceptin) for breast cancer. Cetuximab (Erbitux) for NSCLC. Combined with chemotherapy, only limited improvement. 
  + cost effecive manufacturing
  + widely applicable
  + safe and well toleraged
  + limited efficacy as monotheray
  + mAb-drug conjuages 
  
__T cells can recognize and kill tumor cells__

* Tumoral CD8+ T and Th1 cells are usually positive prognostic markers for survial

__Another early approach: dentritic cells to stimulate T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity__

* DC based immunotherapy Circa 1992
  + high cost and complexity
  + moderate efficacy
  
__Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells__

* recognize highly expressed antigenes independent of MHC
 + High potency against hematological malignancies
 + Not restricted HLA antigens
 + High cost and complexity
 + Can be toxic
 + No demonstrated efficacy yet towards solid tumors
 
__Immue checkpoint blocker__

* PD1, expressed in APC and tumor cells. CTLA-4, only in APC
* Sensitive cancers: melanoma, renal, bladder, lung, gastric, HNSC, ovarian. Other solid tumors are mostly resistent
* Most drastic evidence up to now: Pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) vs. chemotherapy for PD-L1 positive NSLSC. Reck M. et al. NEHJ 2016
 + cost-effective manufacturing
 + well-tolerated
 + durable response against diverse tumors
 + many patients are tumor types are resistent
 + tumors with low mutational burdens
 + tumors lacking PD-1
 + tumors lacking T cell infiltrate ("cold" tumors)
 + Autoimmunity


## Circulating tumor DNA analysis for cancer detection and monitoring
Max Diehn, 10/19/2017

__Introduction__

* 175 bp (one nucleosome wrap)
* 5ng/ml of plasma in healthy adults 
* In cancer, but also non-malignant conditons, such as inflammation
* mostly from hematopoietic cells (80-90%)
* Half-life: 0.5-2 hours
* dynamic range: 1pg/ml-10ng/ml

__Detection methods (Detection limit)__

* Sanger sequencing (>10%)
* Pyrosequencing (10%)
* WES (5%)
* WGS (1%)
* Allele-specific qPCR (0.1%)
* Digital PCR & Targeted NGS (0.05%)
* CAPP-Seq (0.00025%)

__Development of CAPP-seq__

Challenges: limited input molecules,low fractional abundance, inter-patient heterogeneity

* ~300 genes recurrently mutated in NSCLC and SCLC
* Ultra-deep sequencing (>20000x), pre-deduping
* Analytical sensitivity: 0.02%

Improve:

* Increasing number of cfDNA molecules recovered
* Increasing number of mutations covered
* Decreasing background error rare

Molecular barcoding for error repression

Stereotyped errors in cfDNA NGS data

Decreasing sequencing errors in cfDNA sequencing, iDES-enhanced CAPP-Seq

* Barcoding
* Polising

10cc blood 5cc plasma, 30ng cfDNA, 5000 hGEs
Analytic sensitivy : generalized 0.002%, personalized 0.00025%

__Minimal residual disease (MRD)__

Small volumns of tumor cells remaining after treatment in patients who have no clinical evidence of disease

ctDNA MRD detection has been demonstrated in breast and colon cancers. How about lung cancer?

ctDNA is prognostic in node-negative patients. Patients with non-detection MRD cfDNA has longer survial.

ctDNA detections precedes clinical relapse.

__Prospect for personalization of postradiotheray adjuvant treatment__

* cfDNA negative: none
* ctDNA positive: personlized adjuvant therapy
  + Tyrosine kiniase inh
  + Immunotherapy
Chemotherapy
