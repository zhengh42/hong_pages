__Sequence-based prediction of methylation__  

* Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and decision trees: employ sequence and structure derived information (Bhasin et al., 2005, Bock et al., 2006, Das et al., 2006) to classify genes, CpG islands (CGI) or DNA fragments into hypermethylated versus hypomethylated classes.
* limited in its ability to identify cell type, tissue, or condition-specific methylation patterns across dataset
