<center>__Apps__

BY 苏木七

My scale has an app.  
My thermometer has an app.  
My watch has an app.  
My earphone has an app.  
My heater has an app.  
My sex toy has an app.  
Also I just got a cup that has an app.  
TVs, cars, houses,  
Coffee machine, Vitamix blender, vacuum cleaner,  
They all have apps.  
Well, in this apped-up world, why is there still no app for ourselves?  
An app for our metabolism, our hormones,   
Our temper, our genes,   
Our sincerest feelings, our wildest dreams,  
Our deepest fear, and our earnest desire.</center>

<center>__The Phoenix and the Turtle（凤凰和斑鸠）__

BY William Shakespeare  
  
Let the bird of loudest lay   
On the sole Arabian tree   
Herald sad and trumpet be,   
To whose sound chaste wings obey.   
  
But thou shrieking harbinger,   
Foul precurrer of the fiend,   
Augur of the fever's end,   
To this troop come thou not near.   
  
From this session interdict   
Every fowl of tyrant wing,   
Save the eagle, feather'd king;   
Keep the obsequy so strict.   
  
Let the priest in surplice white,   
That defunctive music can,   
Be the death-divining swan,   
Lest the requiem lack his right.   
  
And thou treble-dated crow,   
That thy sable gender mak'st   
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,   
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.   
  
Here the anthem doth commence:   
Love and constancy is dead;   
Phoenix and the Turtle fled   
In a mutual flame from hence.   
  
So they lov'd, as love in twain   
Had the essence but in one;   
Two distincts, division none:   
Number there in love was slain.   
  
Hearts remote, yet not asunder;   
Distance and no space was seen   
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:   
But in them it were a wonder.   
  
So between them love did shine   
That the Turtle saw his right   
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:   
Either was the other's mine.   
  
Property was thus appalled   
That the self was not the same;   
Single nature's double name   
Neither two nor one was called.   
  
Reason, in itself confounded,   
Saw division grow together,   
To themselves yet either neither,   
Simple were so well compounded;   
  
That it cried, "How true a twain   
Seemeth this concordant one!   
Love has reason, reason none,   
If what parts can so remain."   
  
Whereupon it made this threne   
To the Phoenix and the Dove,   
Co-supremes and stars of love,   
As chorus to their tragic scene:   
  
threnos  
  
Beauty, truth, and rarity,   
Grace in all simplicity,   
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.   
  
Death is now the Phoenix' nest,   
And the Turtle's loyal breast   
To eternity doth rest,   
  
Leaving no posterity:   
'Twas not their infirmity,   
It was married chastity.   
  
Truth may seem but cannot be;   
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;   
Truth and beauty buried be.   
  
To this urn let those repair   
That are either true or fair;   
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</center>

<center>__The Dole of the King’s Daughter__

BY Oscar Wilde (1854–1900)

Seven stars in the still water,  
And seven in the sky;  
Seven sins on the King’s daughter,  
Deep in her soul to lie.  
  
Red roses are at her feet,  
(Roses are red in her red-gold hair)  
And O where her bosom and girdle meet  
Red roses are hidden there.  
  
Fair is the knight who lieth slain  
Amid the rush and reed,  
See the lean fishes that are fain  
Upon dead men to feed.  
  
Sweet is the page that lieth there,  
(Cloth of gold is goodly prey)  
See the black ravens in the air,  
Black, O black as the night are they.  
  
What do they there so stark and dead?  
(There is blood upon her hand)  
Why are the lilies flecked with red?  
(There is blood on the river sand.)  
  
There are two that ride from the south and east,  
And two from the north and west,  
For the black raven a goodly feast,  
For the King’s daughter rest.  
  
There is one man who loves her truecenter>  
(Red, O red, is the stain of gore!)  
He hath duggen a grave by the darksome yew,  
(One grave will do for four.)  
  
No moon in the still heaven,  
In the black water none,  
The sins on her soul are seven,  
The sin upon his is one. </center>
