<center>__Apps__</center>

<center>My scale has an app.</center>
<center>My thermometer has an app.</center>
<center>My watch has an app.</center>
<center>My earphone has an app.</center>
<center>My heater has an app.</center>
<center>My sex toy has an app.</center>
<center>Also I just got a cup that has an app.</center>
<center>TVs, cars, houses,</center>
<center>Coffee machine, Vitamix blender, vacuum cleaner,</center>
<center>They all have apps.</center>
<center>Well, in this apped-up world, why is there still no app for ourselves?</center>
<center>An app for our metabolism, our hormones, </center>
<center>Our temper, our genes, </center>
<center>Our sincerest feelings, our wildest dreams,</center>
<center>Our deepest fear, and our earnest desire.</center>
